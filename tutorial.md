# mm you got a hackducky? - lets program it!

Welcome, you want to make a bad usb I see,k. Well, you're in luck! this is the perfect ysws for you !

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Understanding the Basics
The hackducky uses a scripting language similar to duckyscript called hackscript. Its not really much of a difference, aside from hackscript having a few more features allowing you to control your hackducky more.

Every script follows a basic structure:
- **REM**: Comments for humans, ignored by the duck.
- **DEFAULT_DELAY**: Controls the speed of execution.
- **DELAY**: Pauses between actions (milliseconds).
- **STRING**: Types out text like a human.
- **GUI, CTRL, ALT**: Modifier keys for shortcuts.
- **ENTER**: Simulates pressing Enter.

Let's see it in action. This simple script opens Notepad, types a message, and saves the file:

```ducky
REM Basic example script
DEFAULT_DELAY 200

REM Open Run dialog
GUI r
DELAY 500

REM Launch Notepad
STRING notepad
ENTER
DELAY 1000

REM Type some text
STRING Hello from HackDucky!
ENTER

REM Save the file
CTRL s
STRING test.txt
ENTER
ALT F4
```

üí° **What‚Äôs happening here?**
- `GUI r` opens the Run dialog.
- `STRING notepad` types ‚Äúnotepad‚Äù and hits Enter.
- `STRING Hello from HackDucky!` types a message.
- `CTRL s` saves the file as "test.txt".
- `ALT F4` closes Notepad.

Boom! You just automated opening Notepad and saving a file. üéâ

## üî¢ Step 2: Variables and Loops
Want to make your scripts smarter? Use **variables** and **loops**!

### üîÑ Example: Counting to 5
```ducky
VAR counter 0
WHILE $counter < 5
    SET counter $counter + 1
    STRING Count: $counter
    ENTER
END_WHILE
```

üí° **What‚Äôs happening?**
- `VAR counter 0` creates a variable.
- `WHILE $counter < 5` loops while counter is less than 5.
- `SET counter $counter + 1` increases the counter.
- `STRING Count: $counter` types the current count.

Run this, and watch it type "Count: 1", "Count: 2"... up to 5! üöÄ

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 3: Using Functions
Want to reuse some code? Functions make it easy.

### üì¢ Example: Printing a Header
```ducky
FUNCTION PRINT_HEADER
    STRING ==================
    ENTER
    STRING = System Report =
    ENTER
    STRING ==================
    ENTER
END_FUNCTION

CALL PRINT_HEADER
```

üí° **What‚Äôs happening?**
- `FUNCTION PRINT_HEADER` creates a reusable block of code.
- `CALL PRINT_HEADER` runs it whenever needed.
- This prints a neat section header for reports.

## üéØ What‚Äôs Next?  

Now you know the basics‚Äîtime to experiment! Try making:  

‚úÖ **A script that opens a website and types a message**  
‚úÖ **A prank script that rickroles someone as soon as you plug in the usb**  
‚úÖ **A function that automates logins**  
‚úÖ **A script that runs Doom in the terminal!** ‚Äì *Interesting, I see.*  


### ‚ö° Pro Tips:
- Start simple, then add more features.
- Use `DELAY` wisely‚Äîtoo fast and your computer might miss keystrokes.
- Have fun!

Drop your creations in the #hackducky channel on the hack club slack, and let's see what you build! üõ†Ô∏èüî•
